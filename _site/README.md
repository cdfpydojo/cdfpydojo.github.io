# Cardiff Python Dojo

We'd like to run a Python Dojo in Cardiff, based on the format set down by the [London Dojo](http://ldnpydojo.org.uk/). We're currently at the stage of gauging interest in the community and seeking out potential venues and sponsors.

If you'd like to get in touch, send an email to [cardiffpythondojo@gmail.com](mailto:cardiffpythondojo@gmail.com) with any thoughts or suggestions!
